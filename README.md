# mtkclient-installer
mtkclient installer for the unfortunate souls  
Compatible with Windows 10/11, maybe compatible with Windows 8 and 7 but I haven't tested.

## Usage
mtkclient-installer must be ran in Admin mode. To achieve this, open PowerShell or Windows Terminal as an administrator. Here are a few ways to do it:

1. **Right-Click Method:**
   - Right-click on the start menu.
   - Choose "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" (for Windows 10) or "Terminal (Admin)" (for Windows 11).

2. **Search and Launch Method:**
   - Press the Windows key.
   - Type "PowerShell" or "Terminal" (for Windows 11).
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` to launch it with administrator privileges. 
### Launch Command

- Press Win + R, paste this command
```powershell "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netzsworth/mtkclient-installer/main/installer.ps1 | iex"```
